This is a Python application built with the **Tkinter** library that acts as a Password Strength Checker and Generator. It's designed to help users create and evaluate strong, secure passwords to prevent common cyberattacks like brute-force attempts and dictionary attacks.

The program performs three main tasks:

1. Password Strength Check: When you type a password into the input box and click "Check Password," the application evaluates its strength. It checks for a minimum length of 16 characters and the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It also uses the `zxcvbn` library to provide more detailed feedback on the password's quality and suggestions for improvement.

2. Password Breach Check: It checks if the entered password has been compromised in a known data breach. It does this by using the Have I Been Pwned? API. The program doesn't send your full password; instead, it sends the first five characters of a SHA-1 hash of the password to the API, which returns a list of hashes that start with the same five characters. The program then checks if the full hash of your password is in that list, ensuring your actual password is never exposed.

3. Password Generation: The application can generate random, strong passwords of 16, 24, or 32 characters with the click of a button. These passwords include a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.

4. Clipboard Functionality: Users can easily copy the generated or entered password to their clipboard for use elsewhere by clicking the "Copy to Clipboard" button.
